# CSE115-ProjectPart2
Final project for CSE115 at UB. 

A website that visualizes data about the 500 most recent earthquakes 
and implements a fun game where users guess if the next one will have a higher or lower magnitude.


## Requirements
- [x] Choose a data source that you access through a web API
- [x] On your server (in Python), process the data to prepare it for visualization
- [x] On the front-end of your web app, visualize the data with at least 2 different visualizations
- [x] Each visual must be generated by a JavaScript library

## Additional Criteria
- [x] Add communication between users with persistent storage (file or database) on your server (Ex. A comments section)
- [x] Use a web framework other than bottle (Ex. Flask, Django, Tornado)
- [ ] Make a game out of the data using a game framework like phaser
- [ ] Use 2 different data sets instead of just one and combine them on your front-end with at least one visual containing information from both data sets
- [x] Add a secure login system to your app and have at least 1 feature that utilizes this login
- [ ] Scrape data from an HTML web site instead of using an API.
